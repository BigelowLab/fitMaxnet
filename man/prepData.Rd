\title{Prepare SWD files of occurrence and background environmental data}
\usage{
prepData(
  taxonName,
  occData,
  excludedVars = NULL,
  boundsPoly,
  envDataPath,
  outputPath,
  appendDate = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{taxonName}{String (character object) giving the taxonomic name of the entity for which data is being supplied.}

\item{occData}{A numeric matrix or data.frame with at least two columns holding latitude and longitude values for occurrence records. Column names are matched against 'lat' and 'long' in a effort to automagically identify these columns.}

\item{excludedVars}{A chracter vector of variable names to be excluded from output files. Default is NULL.}

\item{boundsPoly}{An sf or SpatialPoylgons* object defining the region within which background points will be selected.}

\item{envDataPath}{String giving the file system path to the folder containing the geoTIFF rasters representing the environmental layers to be used to spatially project a fitted maxnet model}

\item{outputPath}{String giving the file system path to the folder into which occurrence and background SWD files will be written. See \emph{Details} for information about the file naming convention.}

\item{appendDate}{Logical. Should the current system date be appended to output file names? Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns NULL but has side-effect of outputing data files
}
\description{
Load a set of environmental covariate to be used to spatially project a fitted maxnet model and build pairs of SWD-format files
}
\details{
Load raster stack of environmental data layers to be used for fitting a maxnet model and, using coordinate values of occurrence records supplied in \emph{occData} and a background-constraining spatial polygon object, output samples-with-data (SWD) files defined in the original Java implementation of MaxEnt. Two files are produced: an occurence SWD file, and a background points SWD file which are diferentiated by the file name assigned.

NOTE: No checks are made that the projection of occurrence lat/longs or X/Y values matches the raster layers used for environmental data. You must ensure they match before calling this function.
