\usage{
  occThin(occ = NA, xCol = NULL, yCol = NULL, thinDist = 0,
          plot = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{occ}{A dataframe which at least two numeric variables or columns giving the x- and y-coordinates of a set of species occurrence records. There is no constraint at present on the units for x and y.}

  \item{xCol}{Integer value giving the index of the column for the x-coordinate; \emph{or} a character object giving the name of the column.}

  \item{yCol}{Integer value giving the index of the column for the y-coordinate; \emph{or} a character object giving the name of the column.}

  \item{thinDist}{Distance in kilometers to be used to thin occurrence records.}

  \item{plot}{Logical. Should a scatterplot be produced on the standard graphics device. Default is FALSE, do not create a plot.}
}
\value{
  A dataframe with exactly the same column structure as passed in parameter \emph{occ}, but with rows for occurrence records less than \emph{thinDist} from nearest neighbours removed.
}
\description{
  Function \emph{occThin()} performs a spatial thining of a set of species occurrence locations with the intention of reducing spatial sampling bias effects.

\details{
  {
    This function is based on source code for the function \emph{ecospat.occ.dessagregation()} written by Olivier Broennimann and included in the R-package \emph{ecospat}. The original comments from that source code are included below. I think that the original algorithm is extremely clever and very efficient; it out-performs the thin() function in package spThin by at least an order of magnitude, and is faster than my "fast" interpretation of the thin() algorithm by a factor of at least 5. However, the original code for this function had a number of quirks which made it tricky to use in a "production environment" ie for bulk processing hundreds or even thousands of species occurrence files. The following changes and improvements where made:
      \itemize{
        \item Plotting: The original source code made a number of non-standard intialisations of plotting canvases which mightly confused R-Studio (and potentially the standard R graphics device too). The plot parameter now initiates a simple and standard plot without drama.
        \item Handling the full input dataframe: The original code used a rather odd and convoluted way of identifying and using columns representing the x- and y-coordinates which ultimately meant that the object returned was not the full input dataframe with 'bad' rows removed. This function does return the original dataframe with bad rows removed.
        \item Parameters: Simplified the suite of parameters (or arguments) and giving them more meaningful names.
